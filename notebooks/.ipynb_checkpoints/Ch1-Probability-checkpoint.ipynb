    "Why? Mostly because it seems all of the statistics applications I work on are in high dimensional settings. And probability itself, in high dimensions, doesn't believe as we think it does. Typically, maximum likelihood is horrifying in dimensions larger than four (as we will see later); in reasonably standard high dimensional sets (like the n-ball), there is way more probability mass at the limit of the set than everywhere else, and so on.\n",

    "In terms of implementation, the target for the series is to do everything in the notebook in a chapter, then clean the implementation and move it to `.jl` files for the next chapter, import the package at the start of the chapter, and have a fully implemented julia stats package at the end of the process.\n",
