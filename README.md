# Exploration of Probability and Stats in High Dimensions
Roadmap/Goals:
- Everything from scratch (in pure python/numpy? or julia?)
- Start with probabilities, in the vein of the Norvig notebooks
- Then keep that computational approach while re-reading 'All of Statistics'
- Maybe a notebook per chapter?
